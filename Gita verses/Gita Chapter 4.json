      "commentary": "This concluding verse is Krishna's final command to Arjuna. He tells him to use the 'jñānāsinā' (sword of knowledge) to 'chittvā' (cut asunder) the 'saṁśayam' (doubt) that is in his heart. The command to 'uttiṣṭha' (stand up) is a direct, practical call to action, telling Arjuna to apply the knowledge he has received and resume his duty. This is the moment of transformation, where Arjuna is asked to move from a state of philosophical discussion to a state of enlightened action.",
