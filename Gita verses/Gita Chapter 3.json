In Chapter 2, Krishna praised the path of knowledge and a resolute intellect (buddhi) while also urging Arjuna to fight. Arjuna, misunderstanding Krishna's point, sees this as a contradiction. He argues that if knowledge is superior, he should renounce action, not engage in a 'terrible' war. This verse sets the stage for a detailed explanation of Karma Yoga.",

Krishna states that it is more virtuous to perform one's own natural duty, even with flaws, than to perform someone else's perfectly. He says that to die while performing 'svadharma' is a higher path. This is a direct answer to Arjuna's crisis, as it tells him that his duty as a warrior is his sacred path, and to abandon it for the 'dharma' of a renunciate would be 'bhayāvahaḥ' (dangerous) and spiritually counterproductive.",

He explains that the mind is more powerful than the senses, the intellect is more powerful than the mind, but the Self is the most powerful of all. This is a roadmap for inner control. By knowing this hierarchy, Arjuna can understand that to control his senses, he must first control his mind and intellect, and ultimately, he must fix his consciousness on the Self.",

Krishna tells him to use his intellect, which is superior to the mind, to control his lower self. The ultimate goal is to 'kill' the 'kāma-rūpaṁ' (enemy in the form of desire). This verse summarizes the entire chapter, showing that the real battle is not the one on the field but the internal one against desire. It is a powerful message that links action, knowledge, and self-control to achieve the ultimate spiritual goal.",
