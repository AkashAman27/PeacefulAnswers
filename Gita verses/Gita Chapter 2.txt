The 'night' for all beings is the inner spiritual path, and the 'day' is the pursuit of material pleasures. A 'saṁyamī' (self-controlled person) is awake and active on the spiritual path while the world is spiritually asleep. Conversely, the 'muni' (sage) is 'asleep' to the material world's desires, which are so 'real' to everyone else. This verse beautifully illustrates the shift in priorities of an enlightened person.",

This is a direct answer to Arjuna's original sorrow, showing him that true happiness comes from peace, not from external fulfillment.",
