Their ultimate goal is 'mokṣa' (liberation), and they are 'vigata-icchā-bhaya-krodhaḥ' (free from desire, fear, and anger). This state of being is not something to be attained in the future but is a present reality for them. They are 'sadā muktaḥ' (ever-liberated). This verse provides a powerful and inspiring conclusion to the chapter, showing Arjuna the highest state of spiritual freedom.",

He states that by knowing him as the 'bhoktāram' (enjoyer) of all sacrifices, the 'sarva-loka-maheśvaram' (great Lord of all worlds), and the 'suhṛdaṁ' (friend) of all beings, a person attains 'śāntim' (peace). This is a direct answer to Arjuna's initial sorrow and confusion, showing him that peace is not an external achievement but a result of inner transformation and a loving relationship with the divine.",
